## **Projects Included**

### 1. **Recommendation System**
- **Description**: A system that recommends movies to users based on collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.  
- **Features**:  
  - Collaborative Filtering algorithm.
  - Content-based Filtering algorithm.
  - Data exploration and preprocessing.
  - User interface using Flask (`index.html`).  
- **Files**:  
  - `app.py`: Flask application to host the recommendation system.  
  - `collaborative_filtering.py`: Implements collaborative filtering.  
  - `content-based filtering.py`: Implements content-based filtering.  
  - `create_dataset.py`: Generates datasets for training and testing.  
  - `exploration_and_preprocessing.py`: Handles data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.  
  - `movie_interactions.csv`: Dataset with user-movie interactions.  
  - `movies_metadata.csv`: Dataset with metadata about movies.

### 2. **Rule-Based Chatbot**
- **Description**: A simple chatbot that uses rule-based logic to interact with users.  
- **File**: `rule-based chatbot.py`  

### 3. **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**
- **Description**: An AI implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI makes decisions using minimax or heuristic algorithms.  
- **File**: `tic-tac-toe.py`
